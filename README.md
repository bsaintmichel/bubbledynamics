# bubbledynamics

Hello Stranger ! 

Here is the place where I will upload some of the scripts I have been working with 

## What have I been doing in the last year(s) ? 

* I have first checked a bit how bubbles oscillate in a transparent medium and I wrote some code in MATLAB to process my data. I am in the process of converting that to (interactive) Python

* I have also done a bit of data analysis on bubble dissolution and oscillations, but this time with a fluorescent medium in the hope of following the structural changes around the bubbles as a function of time. This is currently not very advanced.
