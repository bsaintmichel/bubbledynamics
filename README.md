# Bubble Dynamics in (i)Python

Hello Stranger ! 

My name is Brice and I am a research scientist working with bubbles and soft materials.

Here is the place where I will upload some of the scripts I have been working with in the last years as a postdoc in the [Garbin group](https://garbinlab.org). You can also find me on my [personal website](https://www.bsaintmichel.fr/en/). 

## What have I been doing in the last year(s) ? 

* I have first checked a bit how bubbles oscillate in a transparent medium and I wrote some code in MATLAB to process my data. I am in the process of converting that to (interactive) Python

* I have also done a bit of data analysis on bubble dissolution and oscillations, but this time with a fluorescent medium in the hope of following the structural changes around the bubbles as a function of time. This is currently not very advanced.
